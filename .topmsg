Subject: Added 'tg checkout'.

This is a convenience command, that helps select the next topic branch
to work on.  You can navigate the dependency graph with 'tg checkout
push' and 'tg checkout pop', and select a specific branch with 'tg
checkout goto PATTERN'.

Using this command, you can give your topic branches descriptive
names, while not having to type those names repeatedly as you switch
branches.
